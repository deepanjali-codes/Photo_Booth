A web-based Photo Booth made with HTML, CSS & JavaScript that turns your browser into a vibe machine.
No downloads. No filters from 2012. Just clean UI and camera magic.

✨ Opens your camera in-browser
📸 Captures photos in real time
🎨 Minimal + aesthetic UI
⚡ Smooth interactions
🧠 Pure frontend logic (no frameworks, no crutches)

Basically: Instagram energy, developer edition.

🛠️ Tech Stack (aka tools of destruction)

🧱 HTML — structure, but make it cute

🎨 CSS — aesthetics doing the heavy lifting

⚙️ JavaScript — camera access & interactivity

Vanilla only. Because we’re built different.
